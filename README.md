# printf

![](https://github.com/a-boring-man/printf/blob/main/100_score_icon.png)

Early Project of 42 school.

The goal was to partially recreate the printf function from C thus learning how to handle call to a function with a variable number of argument.

We could use our previously make library but only if we recreated it calling it's Makefile
